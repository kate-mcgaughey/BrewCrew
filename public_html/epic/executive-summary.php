			<p>Brew Crew (working name) wants to change the way craft beer lovers discover new brews. For breweries, we offer the ability to promote what's on tap. For beer lovers, our technology helps you develop a flavor profile, get recommendations, rate, and review beers. What sets our app apart from others is a compass feature that maps the flavor and intensity of each craft brew in town, sharing with you the best in local beer. Cheers, Albuquerque!</p>
