		<h1><em>BrewCrew DB Design Persona and Use Case</em></h1>
		<h2>Persona</h2>
		<p><strong>Name:</strong> Pamela McConnell </p>
		<p><strong>Age:</strong>40</p>
		<p><strong>Profession</strong>Pamela is a full time Human Resource Manager at a local call center.  She spends approximately half of her day on the desktop computer that is provided by her job, and half of her day talking with the employees at the call center.</p>
		<p><strong>Technology</strong>Pamela mainly uses her company supplied desktop while at work.  In her off time she loves to use her Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge to stay connected to all things social media.  She is an avid user of Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Snap Chat.  She also really enjoys downloading, exploring and using new apps.  She has an ipad air at home that she uses mostly for shopping and streaming.  She is an Amazon Prime member and does almost all of her shopping on Amazon's site.  She uses Netflix, Hulu and Prime to stream all of her favorite shows, and eliminated her cable over a year ago.
		</p>
		<p><strong>Attitudes and Behaviors</strong>Pamela has recently been introduced to the local "craft beer" scene by a group of her HR co-workers.  They have been visiting some local breweries about once a month for Happy Hour.  Pamela is a beer drinker, but usually sticks to a few bottled beers, with Blue Moon being her favorite.  She is completely oblivious to the craft beer world and has discovered that it is a very difficult task to order Blue Moon at the local breweries.  Pamela is excited about the new local brewery happy hours, but is very intimidated by all of the unfamiliar beer options.
		</p>
		<p><strong>Goals:</strong>
			<ul>
			<li>Because Pamela does not know a lot about craft beers she is looking for a tool to help her know what craft beer to order that closely resembles the things she likes best about the bottled beers she is used to. </li>
			<li>Pamela would also like this tool to recommend a local brewery that carries the reccommended craft beer, so that she can suggest that local brewery for the next happy hour meeting.</li>
			<li>Because Pamela is an avid social media person, and because she loves amazon she would like to be able to both read and write user reviews about the craft beers that she tries.</li>
			<li>In addition to reviews, Pamela would absolutely love to be able to add user tags to the beers she tries and search additional beers that might have the same tags</li>
		</ul>
