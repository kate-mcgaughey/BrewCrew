A rating is based on a 5-point scale, and may or may not have an associated text review.  Users can also locate nearby breweries.  They can also search the database of beers by location, type, and rating.  This allows for maximum discover of new craft beers.</p>
			<p>In short, by using this site, a user will be able to discover new beers, locate new breweries, and make recommendations about craft beers.</p>

			<p>By using this site, an administrator will achieve the ability to maintain a current list of on-tap selections in an easily accessible location.  As the webapp will be a hub for craft beer information, maintaining a current list can help drive visitation in that it publicizes beers of limited availability. Users will be able to directly compare and contrast breweries in order to make the most informed choice. Administrators will also be able to update a breweries vital information.  As this includes details like location, hours, and contact information, having up-to-date data for a brewery is critical in ensuring patrons are never met with a closed door, or a similar unpleasant surprise.</p>
