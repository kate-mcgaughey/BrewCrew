		<h1><em>BrewCrew DB Design Persona and Use Case</em></h1>
		<h2>Persona</h2>
		<p><strong>Name:</strong> Pamela McConnell </p>
		<p><strong>Age:</strong>40</p>
		<p><strong>Profession</strong>Pamela is a full time Human Resource Manager at a local call center.  She spends approximately half of her day on the desktop computer that is provided by her job, and half of her day talking with the employees at the call center.</p>
		<p><strong>Technology</strong>Pamela mainly uses her company supplied desktop while at work.  In her off time she loves to use her Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge to stay connected to all things social media.  She is an avid user of Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Snap Chat.  She also really enjoys downloading, exploring and using new apps.  She has an ipad air at home that she uses mostly for shopping and streaming.  She is an Amazon Prime member and does almost all of her shopping on Amazon's site.  She uses Netflix, Hulu and Prime to stream all of her favorite shows, and eliminated her cable over a year ago.
		</p>
		<p><strong>Attitudes and Behaviors</strong>Pamela has recently been introduced to the local "craft beer" scene by a group of her HR co-workers.  They have been visiting some local breweries about once a month for Happy Hour.  Pamela is a beer drinker, but usually sticks to a few bottled beers, with Blue Moon being her favorite.  She is completely oblivious to the craft beer world and has discovered that it is a very difficult task to order Blue Moon at the local breweries.  Pamela is excited about the new local brewery happy hours, but is very intimidated by all of the unfamiliar beer options.

		<p><strong>Goals:</strong>
			<ul>
			<li>Because Britt is already so well versed in all of the local breweries and the normal inventory they offer, Britt would like to be notified when any of the local breweries change or update their on tap offerings. </li>
